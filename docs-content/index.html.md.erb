This documentation describes the ForgeRock Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The ForgeRock Service Broker for PCF enables applications deployed to PCF to benefit from the OAuth 2.0 features and route service provided by the ForgeRock Identity Platform. 

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

The ForgeRock Service Broker for PCF enables applications to integrate with the following features of the ForgeRock Identity Platform:

* AM OAuth 2.0 Service, to obtain OAuth 2.0 access tokens by using the client credentials grant type, and to validate OAuth 2.0 access tokens or OpenID Connect ID tokens passed to your application.
* IG Route Service, to filter traffic to and from Cloud Foundry applications, adapting requests to protect applications, and adapting responses to filter outgoing content.

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

The ForgeRock Service Broker for PCF requires the following installations to be accessible from the PCF environment:

* For the <b>forgerock-am-oauth2</b> service, an instance of [ForgeRock Access Management](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/) v13.0 or later
* For the <b>forgerock-ig-route-service</b> service, an instance of [ForgeRock Identity Gateway](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway/) v5.0 or later

## <a id="install-and-use"></a>Installation and Usage

For information about installing and using the ForgeRock Service Broker, 
see the [ForgeRock Service Broker Guide](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgerock-service-broker/2/forgerock-service-broker-guide).

* AM OAuth 2.0 Service

Through the AM OAuth 2.0 Service, the ForgeRock Service Broker 
automates the process of creating OAuth 2.0 
client profiles, and requires a set of credentials with privileges for 
adding and removing OAuth 2.0 clients. The recommended approach is to 
create a new user in ForgeRock Access Management, add the user to a new group, and give that 
group the `AgentAdmin` privilege, allowing members to create and remove 
OAuth 2.0 clients. 

For information about creating a user and delegating privileges, see 
[To Prepare ForgeRock Access Management for ForgeRock Service Broker Installation](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgerock-service-broker/2/forgerock-service-broker-guide#to-prepare-openam-for-broker-install) 
in the [ForgeRock Service Broker Guide](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgerock-service-broker/2/forgerock-service-broker-guide).

* IG Route Service

The IG Route Service is a fully brokered route service to filter traffic to and from Cloud Foundry applications,
adapting requests to protect applications, and adapting responses to filter outgoing content
